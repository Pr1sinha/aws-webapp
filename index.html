        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Pragya Sinha, and I am a final-year student pursuing a BTech in Biotechnology at the Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology.</p>
        <p>I have good experience in Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and Cloud Computing. I completed an internship with Bharat Intern, where I worked on two minor projects: an autocorrect tool and a translator app. Additionally, I have developed a major project titled 'Content Aggregator with Mood Detection,' which recommends content based on a userâ€™s mood. I also completed an internship as an Application Engineer at Orbit Technomate, where I worked on the 'IoT Sensors to Cloud' project. I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am focused on developing cloud-based projects and gaining experience in the field of software development. Apart from this, I am always eager to learn new technologies and enhance my skills.</p>
